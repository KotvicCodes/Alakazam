# Alakazam
A neat browser extension which optimizes your [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) run, so even you can beat [Dragoon](https://youtube.com/@dragoon45?si=-WajyeQE3sHwMHe7) in 100% completion of the game at home

## Installation Guide
### Disclaimer
This extension will eventually be included on [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/), but as long as the extension is still in its beta version, it is harder to run it on your Cookie Clicker instance.

Also please do not sue me if your computer explodes, implodes or does something unexpected after loading this. However, as long as I've commited something recently, you can be sure my computer survived all my quality code

### Guide
1. Install the repositor to your computer
2. Search for "google://extensions/", "brave://extensions/" or some other extensions page of you Chromium based browser. You may probably also find it under a puzzle icon on your browser's top, to the right of the search bar or in the "more options menu" (most right three lines icon) of your browser
3. Turn on Developer mode
4. Click load unpacked & choose this repo as the file
5. Open Cookie Clicker and profit!

## Todo
- Implement stronger, faster autoclicker
- Implement better strategy of buying upgrades & buildings
- Add some memory, so Alakazam won't go for already completed achievements after refreshing the window
- Add free starting achievements
    - Stifling the press
    - Cookie-dunker
    - Fading luck
